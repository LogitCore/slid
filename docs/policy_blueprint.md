# SLID Policy Blueprint

This document defines baseline policy templates, conventions, and compliance requirements for all SLID components.

## Baseline Policy Principles
- **Minimal privilege:** Components run with only required permissions.
- **Immutability:** All policy changes are tracked and versioned.
- **Auditability:** All significant actions/events are logged and exportable.
- **Compliance:** Must align with NIST-800-94, OWASP, and internal SLID policy.

## Policy Change Process
1. Policy proposal submitted via Pull Request.
2. Review and sign-off by maintainers.
3. CI checks for compliance before merge.

## Incident Handling
- See `/ops/incident.md` for incident management workflow.

## Policy Export & Snapshots
- All policy files exportable in YAML/JSON, signed hash for audit trail.
